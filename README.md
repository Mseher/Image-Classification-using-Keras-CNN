# Image-Classification-using-Keras-CNN
Image Classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow. Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training. Developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This repository contains implementation for multiclass image classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow.
